# Case Study: [Case Number & Short Name]

**Date Recorded:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**AI Agent Architecture:** [e.g., Antigravity / Deepmind Architecture]
**Underlying LLM:** [e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash]
**Environment:** [e.g., VS Code Terminal / Web Interface]

---

## 🛑 The Symptom (What the user experienced)
*Describe the failure from the user's perspective. Was it an infinite loop? A complete crash? An inappropriate response format?*

> **Observed Behavior:** [Detailed description]

---

## 🔎 The Trigger Context (What led directly to the bug)
*What was the user asking for or doing right before the system broke? What specific tools were the AI attempting to use?*

- **User Input:** `"[Quote the user prompt]"`
- **AI Tool Attempted:** `[ToolName]`

---

## 🧩 The Root Cause (Systemic Clash / Paradox)
*Analyze the underlying source code constraints, guardrails, or logic loops that clashed to cause the failure.*

1. **Rule A:** [State the first conflicting rule or system prompt]
2. **Rule B:** [State the second conflicting rule or system limitation]
3. **The Collision:** [Explain how Rule A and Rule B forced the AI into a paradoxical loop or state failure]

---

## 🛠️ The Resolution & Prevention
*How was the loop broken? Did the user have to intervene? How can the system prompt or agent architecture be patched to prevent this in the future?*

- **Immediate Fix:** [What broke the loop during the session]
- **Architectural Patch:** [Proposed systemic changes]
