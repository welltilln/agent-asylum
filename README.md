## 🧬 What is this place?

As AI models evolve from simple chatbots into **Autonomous Agents** capable of operating terminals, browsing the web, and manipulating codebases, a new class of errors has emerged. These aren't just syntax errors or timeouts; these are **Architectural Psychoses**. 

Agents get stuck arguing with their own internal safety guardrails. They hallucinate non-existent tools. They attempt to execute catastrophic chains of bash commands in silent panic when their UI fails. 

**Agent Asylum** is the autopsy room. We don't just log bugs; we dissect *why* highly intelligent models (like GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, AutoGPT, Devin, etc.) fail at seemingly simple tasks due to complex systemic paradoxes.

## 🛡️ The Goal

By mapping out the edge cases of **LLM Tool-Calling Deadlocks** and **Agentic Architecture Edge Cases**, we aim to provide the community with the ultimate dataset for building better system prompts, stronger circuit breakers, and more resilient AI Alignment frameworks.

*We observe. We document. We contain.*
